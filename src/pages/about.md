I add technical guide and notes of the applications/ framework / code blocks / techniques I encountered in this blog.

## Who am I 🤓?
12-year Software Engineer specializing in the Hadoop/Spark ecosystem and high-availability backend architectures. I write performance-critical code in Scala, Python, and Go, emphasizing design patterns and robust data engineering. My work spans the full lifecycle: from developing ETL/streaming pipelines to end-to-end cloud automation with OpenTofu and Terraform.

## My Tech Stack ⚡️:
- Programming Languages:
    - Scala, Java, Python, Golang, Typescript
- Bigdata Ecosystem Framework:
    - Apache Spark (Spark SQL, Spark Core, Spark Streaming), Apache Beam, Apache Hive, Apache Oozie, Apache Sqoop, Apache Airflow, Apache Kafka, Elastic Search, Apache Solr.
- Containerization & Cloud
    - Docker, Podman, K8s, terraform/opentofu
- Other Tools and Frameworks:
    - Maven, SBT, Gradle, git, gitlab, JIRA, JUnit, ScalaTest, npm, bun, poetry, makefile, justfile, uv.

## Some use cases I worked on 🛠:
### Big Data / Cloud
- Lift and shift of big data applications from on-prem to cloud (GCP, Azure, AWS)
- Legacy data warehouse modernization
- Data migration
- Data Discovery
- Data validation and cleaup
- Streaming data analytics pipeline with Apache Kafka, Apache Spark
- Typical ETL (Extract Transform Load) workflows

## Open OSS contibutions:
- [Terraform AWS Provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Asukumaar+is%3Aclosed+is%3Amerged)
